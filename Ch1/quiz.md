# Chapter 1 Quiz - Database Systems

## True or False Questions

1.  A database system stores interrelated data and allows multiple users to access it concurrently.
2.  The relational model is based on tables where rows represent columns and columns represent rows.
3.  SQL is a procedural language for defining database schema.
4.  Data redundancy is one of the problems that database systems aim to solve.
5.  The logical level of abstraction deals with how data is physically stored in the database.
6.  DDL is a language used to access and update the data in a database.
7.  The transaction-management component ensures the consistency of a database in case of system failures.
8.  The storage manager handles user authentication in the database system.
9.  The network model was widely used before the relational model was introduced.
10.  In a two-tier architecture, the client directly accesses the database without any intermediary.
11.  Physical data independence refers to the ability to modify the physical schema without affecting the logical schema.
12.  The query processor optimizes and executes queries written in SQL or other DML languages.
13.  A transaction is a collection of operations that performs a single logical function in a database application.
14.  Relational databases rely on network connections for integrity constraints.
15.  The three-tier architecture includes a client, an application server, and a database server.
