1. **How can the use of aggregate functions in SQL, combined with the `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` clauses, improve data analysis and reporting in complex databases?**

   <summary>Answer</summary>
   Aggregate functions like `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MIN()`, and `MAX()` allow for data summarization in SQL. When combined with `GROUP BY`, these functions can perform calculations across specific groups of data, such as counting the number of orders per customer or calculating the total sales per region. The `HAVING` clause can then be used to filter the results based on aggregate values, allowing for more refined analysis. For instance, a query could be written to show only customers who have placed more than 5 orders.

2. **Describe a situation where using a subquery or nested query would be more efficient or practical than a join in SQL, and explain why.**

   <summary>Answer</summary>
   Subqueries are often more practical when you need to retrieve data that depends on the result of another query. For example, if you need to find all employees whose salary is above the average salary in the company, you can use a subquery to first calculate the average salary and then use that result in the main query. This avoids the complexity of a self-join and keeps the query straightforward. In some cases, subqueries can be more efficient because they allow the DBMS to compute the result of the subquery once, reducing the need for repetitive calculations.
